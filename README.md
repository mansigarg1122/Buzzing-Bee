In this Mini Project, we have created a game “Buzzing Bee”. In which a user controls a bee’s flight height to avoid carnivorous plant called Venus Flytrap, who traps & eats all the insects. Here, this Flytrap plant works as a obstacle for bee.

Pressing Up arrow key for a longer period of time allows the bee to fly higher and not to come in contact of flytrap plant, while letting go causes the bee to fly lower and get trapped by flytrap plant. The life of bee depends on the efficiency of user and for how long the user can manage to do a task. This game is a pygame written in python using VS Code as IDE. Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. We are generating the obstacle randomly by using random function. Sounds, images, characters are inserted to make it more interesting. Also, Using Adobe PhotoShop we have edited the welcome screen of game and size of character “bee” and also few other editing.

Overall, this is a fun game played in single player mode where over passing every flytrap plant without getting trapped will be scored +1 and the moment it get trapped the bee will be dead and end of game. Player have to start the game again to play further.
